Romanian Non-standard UD treebank

The Romanian Non-standard UD treebank (called UAIC-RoDia) is based on UAIC-RoDia Treebank.
This is a bananced treebank. The Contemporary standard part of it (Perez, 2014) was included
in the other Romanian UD Treebank. Since 2015, the UAIC Treebank has been developed by including
several non-standard language genres, Old Romanian, Chat, Folklore.

For the first release, we prepared the first part of the New Testament from Alba Iulia (1648),
916 sentences, as well as folklore in verses; 230 sentences from Romania and 54 from the Republic
of Moldova (where the Romanian language is spoken).
