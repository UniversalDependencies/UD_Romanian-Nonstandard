# Summary

The Romanian Non-standard UD treebank (called UAIC-RoDia) is based on UAIC-RoDia Treebank.

# Introduction

The Romanian Non-standard UD treebank (called UAIC-RoDia)is based on UAIC-RoDia Treebank (The Treebank of the Faculty of Computer Science, ”AL. I. Cuza” University, Iași, Romania). This is a balanced treebank. The Contemporary standard part of it (Perez, 2014) was included in the UD-Romanian-RRT Treebank.
Since 2015, the UAIC Treebank has been developed by including several nonstandard language genres, Old Romanian, Chat, Folklore (Mărănduc 2015, 2016, 2017c, 2018, Perez 2016), considering that the nonstandard langage is more used than the standard one.
The digitization of cultural heritage includes the old texts and also the folklore, wich is an oral phenomenon that is threatened with extinction (Mărănduc, 2017b).

The UAIC-RoDia Treebank (ISLRN 156-635-615-024-0) has now 19,000 sentences in its basic format.

For the first release, we transposed in the UD format a part of the New Testament from Alba Iulia (1648), 916 sentences.
It is the first printed New Testament in Romanian, with Cyrillic letters. The text with Latin alphabet is obtained by an OCR program built at the Institut of Mathematics and Computer Science of Chișinău, Republic of Moldova, by a group of researchers led by Alexander Colesnicov and Ludmila Malahov (Colesnicov 2016, Cojocaru 2017).

The first release includes in the second part, 284 senteces are folklore in verses; 230 sentences from Romania and 54 from the Republic of Moldova (where the Romanian language is spoken)(Bobicev 2016).

For the second release, we finished the transposition in UD format of the first part of the New Testament (1648): all the prefaces and the four Gospels = 5,172 sentences, including the 916 fron the first release.

Also, the contribution of the Republic of Moldova is now 902 sentences folklore, including the 54 sentences from the first relase.
We have now 1132 sentences Folklore.
