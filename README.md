The Romanian Non-standard UD treebank (called UAIC-RoDia) is based on UAIC-RoDia Treebank.

Introduction
UAIC-RoDia Treebank is the Treebank of the Faculty of Computer Science, ”AL. I. Cuza” University, Iași, Romania. This is a bananced treebank. The Contemporary standard part of it (Perez, 2014) was included in the other Romanian UD Treebank. Since 2015, the UAIC Treebank has been developed by including several non-standard language genres, Old Romanian, Chat, Folklore (Mărănduc 2015, 2016, Perez 2016).

For the first release, we prepared the first part of the New Testament from Alba Iulia (1648), 916 sentences. It is the first printed New Testament in Romanian, with Cyrillic letters. The text with Latin alphabet is obtained by an OCR program built at the Institut of Mathematics and Computer Science of Chișinău, Republic of Moldova, by a group of researchers led by Alexander Colesnicov and Ludmila Malahov (Colesnicov 2016, Cojocaru 2017). The second part, 284 senteces are folklore in verses; 230 sentences from Romania and 54 from the Republic of Moldova (where the Romanian language is spoken) (Bobicev, 2016).
